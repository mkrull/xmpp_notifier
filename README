A general purpose xmpp notification bot.

Written to get used to autotools and to play with a bit of boost.

Idea taken from https://github.com/roa/dramaqueen.

Depends on gloox, boost and a kind of C++11 compatible compiler (a recent gcc should do fine).

Known issues:
CPU consumption looks way to high
