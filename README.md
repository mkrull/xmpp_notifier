A general purpose xmpp notification bot.

Written to get used to autotools and to play with a bit of boost.

Idea taken from [dramaqueen](https://github.com/roa/dramaqueen).

Depends on [gloox](http://camaya.net/gloox/), [gtest](http://code.google.com/p/googletest/), [boost](http://www.boost.org/) and a kind of C++11 compatible compiler (a recent gcc should do fine).

To compile run the usual:

```sh
./configure
make
```

To test:

```sh
make test
```
